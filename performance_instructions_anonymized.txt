Animal Play


Performance Instructions:

The piece includes 10 similar versions of the same piece. Each version is ~11 minutes. A performance or recording can be any one or more version, played sequentially, in any order. If multiple versions are played, other music can be played between them if desired.

Everyone
- Accidentals are remembered to the end of the measure in which they occur and only in their own octave.
- Assume everything is slurred and tenuto whenever possible.
- Everything is tutti, when that makes sense.
- Slight rubato, but together, is great.
- No vibrato.
- The double bars indicate changes in overall ensemble volume, alternating quiet, loud, quiet, loud... for the whole piece.
- Tune to the synthesizer tones used in the piece.

Soloists
- Soloists should be louder than everyone else.
- The soloist part should, as much as possible, continuously sound.
- The Violin is the soloist for about the first half of the piece.
- Just after rehearsal mark D the Clarinet becomes the soloist.
- A few bars before rehearsal mark F the Cello becomes the soloist.
- In the last bar the Violin becomes the soloist again for a second.

Violin and Cello
- Notated dyads of a minor second or major second (or diminished third in some cases) should be played as a single pitch anywhere between the two notated pitches. It should sound out-of-tune against the rest of the ensemble. These pitches must be played very steadily, without glissing or adjusting the pitch once you've started playing it.
- Starting just before rehearsal mark D, there is a long stretch where the violin and cello play double stops together. If there are double stops that are impossible to play, you can change your part by leaving one note out, or replacing one or both the notes with pitches the piano is playing, making sure the new double stop isn't a minor second or tritone.

Clarinet
- Your part is in Bb, the clarinet part in the score is in concert pitch. (There is also a part for you in concert, in case that helps.)
- Breathing: it's up to you when to take breaths. Try to keep your parts as legato and sustaining as possible.

Piano
- Play as connected and legato as possible.
- There might be an occassional chord where you can't reach all the notes. In these cases, just leave out a note or notes of your choice. Only leave notes out when absolutely necessary.

Synthesizer
- Can be played on a synthesizer, organ, or prerecorded sounds.
- Feel free to use weights on the keys, as long as you hit your entrances and exits.
- It's up to you to choose the sound, but here are some rules/guidelines:
    - It must sustain continuously without changing volume, pitch, or timbre.
    - No vibrato or oscillations of any kind.
    - The attack and release should be like turning on and off a light -- there should be no envelope at all and no reverb or decay.
    - Something like a triangle wave is probably about the right timbre.
    - The built-in very cheesy MIDI recorder sound that comes with Windows XP or cheap Casio keyboards would be perfect.
    - It should be quiet enough that you could turn it on while music is playing without really noticing, and the effect of turning it off should be like a refrigerator cycling off in the other room -- you didn't notice it was on but now that it is off you can hear all other sounds more clearly.
    - It should be loud enough that notes played by the other instruments clearly harmonize, and "buzz" on fifths and major tenths and such.
    - It must be absolutely in tune with the other instruments.


Note:
Please ignore some of the weird rhythmic notation (tied notes where it should just be a whole note, consecutive small rests where it should just be a whole note rest, some weird spellings in the clarinet part, dynamics under rests, etc). These are artifacts of my composition process that I didn't have the will power to clean up.
