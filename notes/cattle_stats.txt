entrance and exit times of drones are variable within a few beats or bars in either direction

try to choose a variety of drone entrances and exits based on how 'exposed' they are: ie, make sure there is at least one with nothing else happening at the same time (and this should happen late in the piece) and at least one that is totally buried

start at the same time as another instrument starts when other instruments are sustaining
start at the same time as another instrument starts when other instruments are resting
start when other instruments are sustaining
start when everyone else is resting

stop at the same time as another instrument stops when other instruments are sustaining
stop at the same time as another instrument stops when other instruments are resting
stop when other instruments are sustaining
stop when everyone else is resting



soloist should be silent for at least a bar, sometime in the last three sections of each of the biggest sections

soloist exit (fade out) time is variable
