x - build drone harmony options for each pitch in drone #3
x - save harmonies as a list of lists of pitch classes in the bar_configs
x - make bass line
x - adjust soloist/accompaniment settings based on soloist entrances and exists
x - adjust drone entrances and exits in bar_configs and synth part
x - figure out correct tempo
x - change existing harmonic rhythms to use new rhythm notation.
x - redo bassline
x - make mock up accompaniment parts
x - make mock up soloist part
x - fix ties in acc and solo parts
x - choose soloist entrance/exit times and add de/crescendos
x - make real accompaniment parts


- make soloist part for real
    x - pick pitches
    x - extra rhythmic notes

    - extra ties

    - choose density of out of tune notes by volume section
    - out of tune notes

    - ornaments (via rhythm replacement, or grace notes?)
    - make it likely to have scalar motion. try n-grams instead of just previous
    - glissandi?
    - incorporate some transcribed melodies?

- add extra notes in accompaniment parts (more sparingly than soloist, both acc parts in rhythmic unison)
- extra ties in acc parts (both acc parts in rhythmic unison) -- how to find adjacent harmonies with common tones? maybe this is too ambitious.


- add phrase-length harmonic rhythm options

- double stops in accompaniment parts
- out of tune notes in accompaniment parts

- use alternate rhythms in soloist, accompaniment, and piano left hand
    - for soloist, add some extra notes on top of the existing harmonic rhythm
    - go through and tie together some consecutive notes with the same pitch. maybe do 80% or something.
    - is there ever a time when we'd want a completely different rhythm in the melody or accompaniment?
    - do we want to borrow some rhythms for the melody from one of the melody transcriptions I've been thinking about using for years? or from cpe bach israelites page 100?

- add even more extra rhythm notes for soloist:
    - replace some whole notes with [12, 4], [(12, 2), 2], [8, 8], [6, 2, 8], [8, 6, 2], [6, 2, 6, 2], [6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 6] and half notes with [4, 4] and [6, 2]
    - use this method of replacement to add ornaments? if so, how to connect with pitch of first note in next bar?

- clarinet part in Bb

- pick actual notes for piano right hand

- last two bars should have some sort of rhythmic ending (half half whole for example)

x - [forced all flats] force all sharps or all flats? (send score to Katie and Devin to critique the notation)
x - switch clefs where appropriate in cello
